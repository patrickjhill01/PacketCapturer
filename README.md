# PacketCapturer
>Capture all incoming/outgoing TCP/UDP/IP/DHCP/ARP packets on a local network

## Usage

Allows the capturing of raw incoming packets of a local network. This application can be expanded upon to add parsing of different packet types. You can save a list of packets and open them in a txt file. This program also allows for sending custom packets to the network, allowing for DCHP spoofing, ARP attacks, and other Pen Testing processes.
